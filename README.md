# TARP_Project
## Car Automation Using Voice
# Abstract
Technology has progressed to the point where things may happen organically, allowing humans to make things as simple as possible. Voice recognition improves the quality and effectiveness of productivity. In this project, we are designing an automatic car which works on the authority to voice commands of personage through Bluetooth and integrated into mobile applications for commanding the moves. It was very useful for the decrease in traffic passings, enhancement in fuel economy, decrease in travel time, additionally for individuals with disabilities. Car automation using voice works on human voice commands. This was just like a professor instructing students to do the work based on the rules and regulations. In this work, we will connect the circuit with the mobile application through medium communicators. The car can be controlled by remotevoice commands straightforwardly from the client. The car can move frontward, in reverse, left, right, halt, moderate, quick, turn. These actions will be performed by the car according to the given instruction. If the user tells turn right, it changes its current direction and it travels in the right direction.

# Problem Statement
* The objective of the project is to permit people to control vehicles utilizing voice commands. 
* It was exceptionally valuable within the circumstance when there is hectic traffic on the street. 
* For an occasion, when we switch a vehicle to stop, it makes a difference to control the vehicle without taking our eyes off the street.
* Individuals who have challenges with driving, such as disabled, senior citizens would be able to drive without any faltering.It can also be utilized to decrease manual work.
